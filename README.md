I am an Assistant Professor at Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering in COMU. I've got my Ph.D. at Department of Computer Science in University of Cincinnati in Ohio USA, while working at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center.

My research interests lie broadly in the areas of machine learning and natural language processing on areas related to biomedical informations and computational social science. I conduct research using publicly available data sources.
