I am an Assistant Professor in Dept. of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at COMU in Turkey. I completed my doctoral studies at the University of Cincinnati's Department of Computer Science in Ohio, United States, while conducting my dissertation research at the Dept. of Biomedical Informatics at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center.

Machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, topics related to biomedical informatics and computational social science are among my main areas of study interest, while mental health related research problems are my passion.

I earned my Master's degree from Middle East Technical University in Ankara, Turkey, and completed my Bachelor Science education in Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Bilkent University on full scholarship.
